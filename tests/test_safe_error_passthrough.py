"""A teaching message the agent never sees is not a teaching message.

``_safe_error`` reduces unrecognised exceptions to ``"<Class>: operation
failed."`` so raw vSphere text cannot leak. The allowlist it checks against was
an enumeration, and an enumeration drifts: two exceptions this skill raises
deliberately were missing from it, so their messages were replaced by their
class names on the way to the agent.

The missing-password error mattered most — this family's most common first-run
failure, whose entire remedy is the env var name it names. An MCP agent
received ``OSError: operation failed.`` and had nothing to act on.
``TaskStillRunning`` was the second: it exists to say "this is NOT a failure,
keep polling", and arrived as ``TaskStillRunning: operation failed.``

The defect was invisible from the CLI, which prints these messages in full, and
invisible to the error-quality eval, which reads the message at the raise site
rather than what survives the wrapper.

So the rule is the inverse of an enumeration: every exception this skill raises
on purpose passes through, and only genuinely unplanned ones are reduced.

The first repair over-corrected: it admitted bare ``OSError``, which is not
"the errors this skill authored" but "every OS-level error there is" —
including ``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` (certificate subject and hostname),
``socket.gaierror`` (the name that failed to resolve) and connection errors
carrying a full ``scheme://host:port/path``. ``sanitize`` strips control
characters and truncates; it redacts nothing. So the authored error now has an
authored *type*, ``ConfigError``, and the tests below pin both directions: the
remedy still arrives, and the hostnames still do not.
