"""Irreversible and guest-execution CLI commands must double-confirm.

``vm guest-exec`` runs an arbitrary command inside a guest OS and was once the
only such command in this CLI without a confirmation. Nothing enforced the rule,
so the one command where it mattered most was the one that drifted.

**What "must confirm" means here — and why it is not simply "[WRITE]".** The CLI
confirms *irreversible* and *guest-execution* operations, not every state change:
``vm create`` / ``vm power-on`` / ``snapshot create`` are ``[WRITE]`` but additive
and intentionally do NOT prompt. There is no single reliable marker for the
"needs a prompt" set — it is the author's per-command judgement:

* ``destructiveHint`` marks data-destroying ops (delete / revert / clean-slate /
  power-off) but is ``False`` for guest-exec, clone and migrate;
* ``--dry-run`` is added to some *additive* previews too (create, power-on);
* ``[WRITE]`` is far broader than "dangerous".

So this file does NOT claim to guard every destructive command (an earlier
version derived from ``[WRITE]`` and, via a tool-name↔ops-name mismatch, silently
guarded only two — 踩坑 #43). It guards the subset that is **unambiguously**
must-confirm: every tool the MCP layer marks ``destructiveHint=True``, plus the
guest-execution tools (arbitrary code in a guest, the widest blast radius). Those
are derived structurally (marker → the ops function the CLI actually calls), and
the intersection with real CLI commands is asserted to be broad, not just its two
source sets non-empty.
