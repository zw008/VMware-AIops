"""Shared MCP server primitives: the FastMCP instance, connection helper,
error sanitisation, and the ``@tool_errors`` decorator.

Tool modules under ``vmware_aiops/mcp_server/tools/`` import ``mcp`` from here and register
their ``@mcp.tool()`` functions onto it. ``vmware_aiops/mcp_server/server.py`` then imports
those modules and runs the server.

Keep ``Optional[X]`` (never PEP 604 ``X | None``) in any FastMCP-reflected
tool signature — on Python 3.10 with older mcp/pydantic the union is eval'd to
``types.UnionType`` and FastMCP's ``issubclass`` check crashes (踩坑 #33).

def _safe_error(exc: Exception, tool: str) -> str:
    """Return an agent-safe error string; log full detail server-side only.

    Raw exception text can carry vSphere response bodies, internal paths, or
    host:port pairs. Full traceback goes to the server log; the agent sees only
    a control-char-stripped, length-capped message.

    The rule is a property, not a list: every exception this skill raises on
    purpose passes through, and only genuinely unplanned ones are reduced. The
    enumeration below is the mechanical expression of that rule, and it drifts —
    each domain exception added under ``vmware_aiops.ops`` without a matching
    entry here loses its teaching message on the way to the agent, which is the
    exact dead end those messages exist to remove.

    The missing-password error — this family's most common first-run failure,
    whose entire remedy is the env var name it carries — arrives as
    ``ConfigError``, a narrow ``OSError`` subclass ``config.py`` raises on
    purpose. Bare ``OSError`` is deliberately *not* here: it would also admit
    ``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` (certificate subject and hostname),
    ``socket.gaierror`` (the name that failed to resolve) and
    ``requests``-style connection errors (the full ``scheme://host:port/path``),
    none of which are authored text. ``sanitize`` strips control characters and
    truncates; it redacts nothing, so breadth here is exposure. TLS errors are
    rejected ahead of the list because they also subclass ``ValueError`` and an
    allowlist therefore cannot exclude them — see the comment below.
    ``FileNotFoundError``, ``PermissionError``, ``TimeoutError`` and
    ``ConnectionError`` stay because each is raised deliberately somewhere in
    this skill with a remedy in the message.

    Anything else is reduced to its type — an unplanned exception's text was
    written for a developer reading a traceback, not for an agent choosing what
    to do next, and it is the one that can carry credentials.

    """Wrap a tool body in the canonical try/except → ``_safe_error`` pattern.

    Collapses the ~41 near-identical error blocks. Behaviour is byte-for-byte
    identical to the inline handlers it replaces — the only difference is the
    error payload shape, selected per the tool's declared return type:

    * ``"str"``  → ``f"Error: {msg} {hint}"``
    * ``"dict"`` → ``{"error": msg, "hint": hint}``
    * ``"list"`` → ``[{"error": msg, "hint": hint}]``

    The decorated tool name passed to ``_safe_error`` is ``func.__name__``,
    matching the literal names used by the original inline blocks.

    Place this *between* ``@vmware_tool`` and the function so the audit
    decorator and FastMCP still see the original signature (preserved via
    ``functools.wraps``); the wrapper catches exceptions exactly where the
    inline ``try/except`` did, so ``@vmware_tool`` never observes them.

    Because it never observes them, the failure has to be *declared*:
    ``report_tool_failure`` runs before the error payload is returned, inside
    the ``@vmware_tool`` call still in flight. Without it a caught failure was
    audited ``status=ok``, told the circuit breaker ``success=True``, and — for
    the writes that carry an ``undo`` descriptor — recorded a token offering to
    reverse a change that never landed.
