"""Host VMkernel adapter management + MTU-path diagnostic.

add/remove/list vmks ride the standard vSphere API (HostNetworkSystem).
vmk_ping rides esxcli-over-API: HostSystem.RetrieveManagedMethodExecuter()
-> ExecuteSoap on the host's "network diag ping" CLI handler - the same
mechanism PowerCLI's Get-EsxCli uses, works through a vCenter connection,
no host SSH required.

Design notes:
- add_host_vmk sets NO gateway (vSphere vmk IpConfig has no gateway field;
  default routes are per-netstack) and enables NO services - both deliberate:
  the use case is throwaway test vmks on L2-only segments (e.g. TEP VLANs).
- remove_host_vmk FAILS CLOSED. It refuses when the vmk is selected for ANY
  host service (management/vMotion/vSAN/...), when it lives on a non-default
  netstack (vxlan/NSX TEPs, dedicated vmotion/provisioning stacks - those
  vmks NEVER appear in the service map, so the map alone cannot protect
  them), when it carries a default gateway route, or when any of that CANNOT
  be verified. ``force_unprotected=True`` (with ``confirm=True``) overrides
  every protection except one absolute: the host's only management-enabled
  vmk is never removable - the call rides the interface it would delete, and
  after it succeeds nothing can reach the host to undo it.
