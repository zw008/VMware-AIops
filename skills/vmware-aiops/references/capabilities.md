# Capabilities Reference

## Automation Level Reference

Each operation is classified by autonomy level per the Enterprise Harness Engineering framework. This tells AI agents how much human gating each tool needs:

| Level | Meaning | Agent autonomy | Examples in this skill |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Read-only, raw data | Always auto-run | `cluster_info`, `browse_datastore`, `scan_datastore_images`, `list_vcenter_alarms`, `vm_list_snapshots`, `vm_list_ttl`, `vm_task_status` |
| **L2** | Read + analysis / recommendation | Always auto-run | `cluster_health_summary`, `cross_vcenter_attention`, `vm_investigation_bundle`, `host_investigation_bundle`, `datastore_investigation_bundle`; scheduled scan reports, alarm/event correlation, log pattern analysis |
| **L3** | Single write — user must approve | Only after explicit confirmation; high-risk ops require double-confirm (see Confirmation column) | `vm_power_on`, `vm_power_off`, `vm_delete`, `vm_create_snapshot`, `vm_clone`, `vm_migrate` |
| **L4** | Multi-step plan / apply workflow | Plan generation auto; apply gated by user approval | `vm_create_plan` → `vm_apply_plan` → `vm_rollback_plan`, batch-clone, batch-deploy YAML |
| **L5** | Auto-remediation from learned pattern | Pattern library only; requires `risk:low` + `reversible:true` + `repeatable:true` + signed approval | *(roadmap — not implemented; candidates: snapshot consolidation, orphaned VM cleanup)* |

**Notes**:
- L1/L2 tools are always safe for agents to call without confirmation.
- **List envelope**: the read list tools (`browse_datastore`, `list_vcenter_alarms`, `vm_list_plans`, `vm_list_snapshots`, `vm_list_ttl`) return `{items, returned, limit, total, truncated, hint}` instead of a bare array, so an agent can tell a complete answer from a first page rather than inferring it (issue #31). All five enumerate their collection in full before any limit is applied, so `total` is always the real count; only `list_vcenter_alarms` takes a `limit` and can therefore report `truncated: true`. The write `batch_*` tools deliberately keep a bare list — each row is a per-item result of work already done, complete by construction. Errors from these read tools are `{error, hint}` (a dict, not a one-element list).
- L3+ tools always pass through the `@vmware_tool` decorator: connection check → policy check → audit log → optional double-confirm.
- See [vmware-pilot](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Pilot) for cross-skill L4 orchestration and the Dispatcher/Subagent pattern.

## Triage & Object Investigation (read-only)

Five opinionated read-only reports that **aggregate and correlate server-side** and
return high-signal results — never raw inventory. They exist so the agent can decide
*where to look* before actuating anything. All five delegate to the
[vmware-monitor](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Monitor) library using AIops' own
vCenter connection, so **`vmware-monitor` must be installed**; without it these tools
are unavailable. All are point-in-time (no trending). Each has a `--html` CLI form
that writes a self-contained, timestamped offline snapshot (no external references,
drill-downs collapse via native `<details>`, zero JavaScript).

| Operation | CLI | MCP Tool | vCenter | ESXi |
|-----------|-----|----------|:-------:|:----:|
| Cluster health summary | `summary` | `cluster_health_summary` | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cross-vCenter attention | `attention` | `cross_vcenter_attention` | ✅ | ❌ |
| VM investigation bundle | `investigate vm <name>` | `vm_investigation_bundle` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Host investigation bundle | `investigate host <name>` | `host_investigation_bundle` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Datastore investigation bundle | `investigate datastore <name>` | `datastore_investigation_bundle` | ✅ | ✅ |

### `cluster_health_summary` — "is anything on fire?"

The first look. Rolls up hosts, VM power state, live CPU/memory pressure and triggered
alarms per cluster, assigns an opinionated `ok` / `warn` / `critical` status, and
flattens individual anomalies into a ranked `top_issues` focus list (worst first, each
carrying a drill-down hint). Returns `{totals, top_issues, issues_total, clusters,
snapshot, customization_hint}` — lead with `top_issues`, show `clusters` as context.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Behavior |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| `target` | str (optional) | default target | Named vCenter/ESXi target from `config.yaml` |
| `cluster_filter` | str (optional) | None (all) | Case-insensitive substring; suppresses standalone-hosts bucket |
| `include_vms` | bool | True | Roll up VM power counts; False skips the VM pass (faster on huge fleets) |
| `top_n` | int | 10 | Cap the `top_issues` focus list; `issues_total` keeps the pre-cap count; 0 hides the list |

**Typical response tokens**: ~120–400 (one compact row per cluster + totals); scales
with cluster count, not VM count. Aggregation happens in the tool — the model never
sees raw inventory.

### `cross_vcenter_attention` — "where do I look first, anywhere in the estate?"

Merges every configured target's cluster-health summary into a single globally ranked
`top_issues` list (each item tagged with its `vcenter`) plus a per-target rollup.
Degrades gracefully: an unreachable target is listed under `unreachable` and the rest
still aggregate. Use it before `cluster_health_summary` when more than one vCenter is
configured; with a single target, go straight to `cluster_health_summary`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Behavior |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| `cluster_filter` | str (optional) | None (all) | Case-insensitive cluster substring applied to every target |
| `top_n` | int | 10 | Cap the merged `top_issues` focus list |

**Typical response tokens**: ~200–600 (ranked issue list + one row per target); scales
with target count, not inventory size.

### `*_investigation_bundle` — one correlated drill-down per object

Use **after** triage points at a specific object. Each bundle collects and *correlates*
the object with its surrounding infrastructure and recent history in one batched call,
so the agent does not stitch together separate info/alarm/snapshot/performance/event
reads. All three accept `hours` (event-timeline look-back, default 24) and an optional
`target`. An unknown object name returns a teaching error naming how to list objects.

| Tool | Required arg | Correlates |
|------|--------------|------------|
| `vm_investigation_bundle` | `vm_name` | VM state, the host it runs on, cluster context, backing datastores, snapshots, triggered alarms, live performance, merged event timeline (VM + host + cluster + datastores, newest first) |
| `host_investigation_bundle` | `host_name` | Connection state, CPU/memory, ESXi version, uptime, cluster context, rollup of VMs it runs, datastores it mounts, alarms across host/cluster/datastore, live performance, merged event timeline |
| `datastore_investigation_bundle` | `datastore_name` | Capacity/free space/accessibility, hosts that mount it, rollup of VMs it backs, alarms across datastore/host, merged event timeline. (Per-datastore latency is a separate perf report, not included.) |

**Typical response tokens**: ~400–1200 per bundle (correlated summary + capped event
timeline); grows with the `hours` window, not with fleet size. Explain the result in
operational language — do not dump it raw.

## VM Lifecycle

| Operation | Command | Confirmation | vCenter | ESXi |
|-----------|---------|:------------:|:-------:|:----:|
| Power On | `vm power-on <name>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Graceful Shutdown | `vm power-off <name>` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Force Power Off | `vm power-off <name> --force` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reset | `vm reset <name>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Suspend | `vm suspend <name>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| VM Info | `vm info <name>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create VM | `vm create <name> --cpu --memory --disk` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete VM | `vm delete <name>` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reconfigure | `vm reconfigure <name> --cpu --memory` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Snapshot | `vm snapshot-create <name> --name <snap> [--description <text>] [--memory]` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| List Snapshots | `vm snapshot-list <name>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Revert Snapshot | `vm snapshot-revert <name> --name <snap>` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete Snapshot | `vm snapshot-delete <name> --name <snap> [--remove-children]` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Poll Async Task | `vm task-status <task-id>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Clone VM | `vm clone <name> --new-name <new> [--to-host <host>] [--to-datastore <ds>]` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| vMotion | `vm migrate <name> --to-host <host> [--to-datastore <ds>]` | Double | ✅ | ❌ |
| Set TTL | `vm set-ttl <name> --minutes <n>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cancel TTL | `vm cancel-ttl <name>` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| List TTLs | `vm list-ttl` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Clean Slate | `vm clean-slate <name> [--snapshot baseline]` | Double | ✅ | ✅ |
| Guest Exec | `vm guest-exec <name> --cmd /bin/bash --args "-c 'whoami'"` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Guest Upload | `vm guest-upload <name> --local f.sh --guest /tmp/f.sh` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Guest Download | `vm guest-download <name> --guest /var/log/syslog --local ./syslog` | — | ✅ | ✅ |

> Guest Operations require VMware Tools running inside the guest OS.

> `vm task-status` / `vm_task_status` polls a vSphere task id returned by an async
> write (today: `vm_delete_snapshot`) instead of re-running the operation. Returns
> state (`queued` / `running` / `success` / `error` / `gone`), progress percent, and
> the entity name. `gone` means vCenter already garbage-collected a completed task —
> re-list the resource to confirm the final state. A failed task carries its fault
> under `task_error`, not `error` — the poll succeeded, the task did not.
> **Typical response tokens**: ~40–80 (single status record).

## Plan → Apply (Multi-step Operations)

For complex operations involving 2+ steps or 2+ VMs, use the plan/apply workflow:

| Step | MCP Tool / CLI | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1. Create Plan | `vm_create_plan` | Validates actions, checks targets in vSphere, generates plan with rollback info |
| 2. Review | — | AI shows plan to user: steps, affected VMs, irreversible warnings |
| 3. Apply | `vm_apply_plan` | Executes sequentially; stops on failure |
| 4. Rollback (if failed) | `vm_rollback_plan` | Asks user, then reverses executed steps (skips irreversible) |

Plans are stored in `~/.vmware-aiops/plans/`, deleted on success, auto-cleaned after 24h.

## VM Deployment & Provisioning

| Operation | Command | Speed | vCenter | ESXi |
|-----------|---------|:-----:|:-------:|:----:|
| Deploy from OVA | `deploy ova <path> --name <vm>` | Minutes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Deploy from Template | `deploy template <tmpl> --name <vm>` | Minutes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Linked Clone | `deploy linked-clone --source <vm> --snapshot <snap> --name <new>` | Seconds | ✅ | ✅ |
| Attach ISO | `deploy iso <vm> --iso "[ds] path/to.iso"` | Instant | ✅ | ✅ |
| Convert to Template | `deploy mark-template <vm>` | Instant | ✅ | ✅ |
| Batch Clone | `deploy batch-clone --source <vm> --count <n>` | Minutes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Batch Deploy (YAML) | `deploy batch spec.yaml` | Auto | ✅ | ✅ |

### Guest Operations Notes

`vm_guest_exec_output` — execute a shell command and **capture stdout/stderr** automatically. OS auto-detected (Linux/Windows) via `vm.guest.guestFamily`. No manual redirection needed.

`vm_guest_provision` — run an ordered sequence of exec/upload/service steps in one call. Stops on first failure. Typical use: SSH key injection → package install → service start.

## Datastore Browser

| Feature | vCenter | ESXi | Details |
|---------|:-------:|:----:|---------|
| Browse Files | ✅ | ✅ | List files/folders in any datastore path |
| Scan Images | ✅ | ✅ | Discover ISO, OVA, OVF, VMDK across all datastores |

> For datastore management, iSCSI, and vSAN, use [vmware-storage](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Storage). For Tanzu Kubernetes, use [vmware-vks](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-VKS).

## Cluster Management

| Operation | Command | Confirmation | vCenter | ESXi |
|-----------|---------|:------------:|:-------:|:----:|
| Cluster Info | `cluster info <name>` | — | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create Cluster | `cluster create <name> [--ha] [--drs]` | — | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete Cluster | `cluster delete <name>` | Double | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add Host | `cluster add-host <cluster> --host <host>` | Double | ✅ | ❌ |
| Remove Host | `cluster remove-host <cluster> --host <host>` | Double | ✅ | ❌ |
| Configure HA/DRS | `cluster configure <name> [--ha/--no-ha] [--drs/--no-drs]` | Double | ✅ | ❌ |

> `remove-host` requires the host to be in **maintenance mode** first; the host is moved out of the cluster into the datacenter's host folder as a standalone host (`Folder.MoveIntoFolder_Task`).

## Alarm Management

| Operation | Command | Confirmation | vCenter | ESXi |
|-----------|---------|:------------:|:-------:|:----:|
| List Triggered Alarms | `alarm list [--target <t>]` | — | ✅ | ❌ |
| Acknowledge Alarm | `alarm acknowledge <entity> <alarm>` | — | ✅ | ❌ |
| Clear (Reset) Alarms | `alarm reset <entity> <alarm>` | Double | ✅ | ❌ |

> **Blast radius**: vSphere has no per-alarm clear API. `alarm reset` / `reset_vcenter_alarm` uses `AlarmManager.ClearTriggeredAlarms`, which clears **all** triggered alarms matching the named alarm's entity type (host/VM/all) and current status (red/yellow) — not just the named one. The named alarm is looked up first (typos fail fast), and the result's `scope` field reports exactly what was cleared. Cleared alarms re-trigger automatically if their underlying condition persists.

## Scheduled Scanning & Notifications

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Daemon | APScheduler-based, configurable interval (default 15 min) |
| Multi-target Scan | Sequentially scan all configured vCenter/ESXi targets |
| Scan Content | Alarms + Events + Host logs (hostd, vmkernel, vpxd) |
| Log Analysis | Regex pattern matching: error, fail, critical, panic, timeout |
| Webhook | Slack, Discord, or any HTTP endpoint |

## Safety Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Plan → Confirm → Execute → Log | Structured workflow: show current state, confirm changes, execute, audit log |
| Double Confirmation | All destructive ops (power-off, delete, reconfigure, snapshot-revert/delete, clone, migrate, alarm clear) require 2 sequential confirmations — no bypass flags |
| Rejection Logging | Declined confirmations are recorded in the audit trail for security review |
| Audit Trail | All operations logged to `~/.vmware/audit.db` (SQLite WAL, via vmware-policy) with before/after state |
| Input Validation | VM name length/format, CPU (1-128), memory (128-1048576 MB), disk (1-65536 GB) validated before execution |
| Password Protection | `.env` file loading, never in command line or shell history; file permission check at startup |
| SSL Self-signed Support | `disableSslCertValidation` — **only** for ESXi hosts with self-signed certificates in isolated lab/home environments. Production environments should use CA-signed certificates with full TLS verification enabled. |
| Task Waiting | All async operations wait for completion and report result |
| State Validation | Pre-operation checks (VM exists, power state correct) |
